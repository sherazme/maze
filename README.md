Maze Game project

# Maze Game Project

## Inspiration

Ever since I was a child, I’ve had a passion for games—especially puzzles and challenges. This love inspired me to create a maze game as part of my portfolio project for the ALX SE Foundation program. I wanted to design a game that not only entertains but also sharpens problem-solving skills, reminiscent of the hours I spent challenging friends and family to navigate through intricate mazes.

## Technical Challenges

One of the biggest hurdles I faced was using SDL2 for the first time. The documentation was extensive, and I initially felt overwhelmed. However, I recognized that overcoming this challenge was essential for my growth as a developer. I dedicated time to understanding the library, experimenting with its features, and seeking help from online communities. This struggle ultimately transformed into a rewarding learning experience.

## What’s Next?

Looking ahead, I envision expanding this project by adding new features such as multiplayer functionality and enhanced graphics. I believe these additions will create a more immersive experience for players. I'm excited to further explore game development and continue refining my skills.

## Emotional Journey

This project was not just a technical endeavor; it was a journey of self-discovery. I learned the importance of perseverance and adaptability, especially during moments of frustration. Each challenge I faced helped me grow as an engineer, and I am proud of the outcome.
